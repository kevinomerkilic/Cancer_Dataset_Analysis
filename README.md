# Cancer Breast Dataset Logistic Regression

This project is a revamp of my previous project with K- Nearest Neighbors except now it involves now a series of Machine Learning Algorithms. To be specific it is a linear model that I created not using built in functions.

Key details is that the sigmoid function is a custom built, as well as the gradients as well as updating the weights, and the bias.
